Data Provided:

m_mock_transaction_20190621.csv
•    PC Transaction data for a period of 6 months.
•    Revenue is raw data (no fees applied).

m_mock_active_users_20190621.csv
•    Daily active users by country for a period of 6 months.
•    Values are unitless and relative, can be used for evaluation of trends, 
	comparisons between countries, etc.

m_vendor_map.csv
•    Transaction percentage associated with vendor.
•    Smaller vendors currently have 'unknown' fees. 
	Choose how best to deal with this in your analysis.


Problem Summary:
In Warframe, players buy various items (denoted by a sku) with real world money. 
These transactions can be handled by a variety of vendors. 
These vendors help facilitate transactions and take a cut of the revenue. 
One area of work is in the optimization of these vendors (ie. Which vendors to present to users, 
and under what circumstances should these vendors be offered). 
The key point here being, since different vendors take different cuts, 
will removing high fee vendors result in partial or total migration to alternative, lower fee, 
vendors. 
On April 1st one such vendor (vendor37) was temporarily shut down due to external circumstances. 
The transaction data in m_mock_transaction_20190621.csv is a record of all transactions in the 
3 months preceding this shutdown, and the 3 months since. 
We are now asked by the finance department to determine 
whether it is beneficial for us as a company to reopen vendor37 or 
if it should remain closed. Provided is all the data required to carry out analysis 
behind this question, and to provide an argument for or against reopening vendor37. 
Below you will find 2 specific focus areas to loosely structure your analysis on.


Part 1: General Analysis
The main point here is giving us (and the finance department) a general overview of the data. 
Isolating key metrics and presenting them in a clear way is essential. 
This is meant to be a basic analysis (ie. modelling is not required). 
Below is a list of general metrics we would like to be covered:
•    Before closure – what did revenue look like for vendor37? - done
	•    Proportion of total revenue - done
	•    Revenue and transactions per day through vendor37 - done
	•    Regional usage details - done
•    What is an upper bound for revenue loss as a result of the closure? - done
•    Number of users expected to be affected by the closure? - done
•    Is there a measurable revenue change as a result of the closure (on April 1)? - done
	•    How about regionally? - done
•    How does the spending of vendor37 users after closure compare to the 
	spending of the users of other vendors? - done
•    Is there any indication that vendor37 users have migrated to new vendors?-done

the account id is the users trace them back vendor and see how their spending pattern change
make a pie chart of the users to compare their 
spending/transaction with other vendor before and after closure (check the volume of the purchases)
make sure to take the mean of the revenue

Part 2: Modelling
You've done the basic analysis to identify whether the closure was positive or negative for us. 
The next question that arises is "what would revenue look like if vendor37 had not been closed". 
Use the data provided to construct a revenue model (of your choosing). 
This section is particularly open-ended. Impress us with your modelling abilities, or 
learn something new and apply it to this problem. 
How does this model support your previous argument (or not)?

Please provide your analysis source files ( .py, .ipnb ) and any other files which you used to 
perform your analysis( .xls, .csv ). 
Good luck!
